# rock-paper-scissors_game
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player competes against the computer, which makes random choices. The game tracks scores, updates results in real time, and includes a reset button. Great for learning DOM manipulation and basic game logic.
